			<h1 class="hi"><strong>Hi there!!</strong> I am an Indutrial designer</h1>
			<p class="welcome">...Thanks for coming...</p>
			
			<p class="paragraph">Yes I am an industrial designer so I create “things” … but sometimes I also paint, draw and do some coding. <strong>Why?</strong> Because I like it… I like learning new skills and explore new software. I like challenging myself. This is why after 5 years of experience in commercial design and P.O.P I took an airplane and came down and under (all the way from Colombia to Sydney) to learn and face other challenge… in other language. In this new place I have done some freelance jobs in drafting, designing and video editing. I am still learning about coding. In fact you are looking at my first creation… this website… Thanks to my fulltime job I have improved my customer service, management skills and of course my capacity of working under pressure and solving problems quick and efficient.

			<p class="paragraph1">This is my website portfolio and you will see some of the most relavant designs I have created during my work experience. Each of them had taught me something important that I have not forgoten and have put in practice for other designs.</p>
			<p class="skills">My Skills</p>
			<p class="skills1"> Well.. this are some of the software I use. I might not be a complete expert in some of them but I think I can work on them. In some others I am not to bad.</p>
